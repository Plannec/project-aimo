# project-aimo
Welcome to 'project-aimo', our little game.

## What is this?
This game should be a open-source game with sweet graphics and nice gameplay. Currently there's nothing, but we're working on new assets and gameplay content *(if there would be motivation)*.

## Story
*Currently on ice.* It's just a plain prototype, not more not less.

## When can I play the game?
Nobody knows how long this takes. Maybe never, maybe in 2 years.

## Additional information

### Genre
Aimo should be an **Plattform-Shooter**. Means a normal shooter but in 2D!

### Target platforms
We're focusing on **windows**, because ~96% of all players using windows. But we are also interested to support **linux** with the same performance.
